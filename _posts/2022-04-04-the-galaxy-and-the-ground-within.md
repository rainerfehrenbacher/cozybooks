The heart of this book examines how strangers come together in an emergency situation to help each other out. This book does what each of the other books in this series (and all good science fiction for that matter) does so well - it uses the canvas of an alien world to examine deep truths about the realities of the world that we inhabit today.

The concept of mutual aid and collective support is one that is highly relevant at the moment. On the one hand, we are faced with new catastrophes on a weekly basis. The pandemic that's killed 6 million people is overshadowed by the threat of impending nuclear war. On top of all of that, we live in a hyper-capitalistic society that has taught us to fear our neighbors. We are plugged into social media, but completely unplugged from our communities.

This is the soil into which this book tosses the seeds of mutual aid. In his book "Walkaway", Cory Doctorow creates the idea that there are two kinds of people who are defined by what they will take to their neighbor's house in an emergency: shotguns or casseroles. "The Galaxy and the Ground Within" paints a beautiful picture of what it looks like when a handful of strangers are forced to take shelter in a shared space during an emergency. Not only are all of these characters "casserole people", but they are also forced to process through their own personal baggage as well.

This book (and this entire series, really) should be required reading for all fans of science fiction. I cannot recommend it enough.
