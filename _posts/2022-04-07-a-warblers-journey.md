In "A Warbler's Journey" Scott Weidensaul and Nancy Lane (illustrations) have collaborated to make a children's book that is an instant classic.

This book is so beautiful on so many different levels. Not only are the illustrations captivating, but it also introduces children to many important topics such as the interdependence of ecosystems and agriculture, the necessity of green spaces in residential areas, and the migratory nature of birds.

There are so many points in this book where readers can choose to stop and ask questions to help their child learn, such as "Do you know what *abuelito* means?"
