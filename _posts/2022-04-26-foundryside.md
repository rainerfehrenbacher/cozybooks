##  A Heartwarming Collection of Intriguing Stories 
<br>

This book was at times a delight, and at other times a slight burden. I really enjoyed all of the stories that were included in this book, and there are so many talented authors who contributed to this wonderful collection.

The stories made me cherish the relationships in my life. It's really a celebration of love in all its many forms. While some stories focused on romantic love, others focused more on the love that exists between family members.

The one thing that made this book feel like something of a burden at times is that each new story brings with it a large amount of world-building. Stories about time travel have a lot of context to establish in order to make the plot points seem believable. In a larger single-narrative story, much of this work would be done at the outset and then the reader could enjoy the development of the characters/plot inside of that world. In this collection, each new story brings with it the demand of building a new mental framework for understanding the story. Some of the stories are very dense with this kind of "just keep reading and eventually it will make sense and you will love it" kind of stuff, and on its own there's nothing wrong with that. But that's the reason why I'm putting this at a 4/5 instead of a 5/5.

All in all, I highly recommend reading this collection (at your own pace).
