There are some really beautiful aspects of this book, but there's just far too much going on in this story for my taste. This felt like at least 2 different novels that were mashed into one, and perhaps that's part of what the author was going for. The plot might suggest that something which seems a bit off and out of place is exactly what the author is trying to create, but even in the midst of knowing that the ending was still a weird combo of beauty and also head scratching. Good read, would recommend for someone to take on a vacation but definitely set your expectations.
